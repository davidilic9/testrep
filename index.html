        <p class="">Because your copy is your biggest asset. You can sell the best product in the world. But if you
            don't have a well-written copy, you'll remain cashless.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="">It's really simple. Bad copy destroys you. Good copy turns websites into lead-generating
            machines.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="">I’m here to write good copy, flip the switch in your customers' brains and make your business grow.
            I'm not interested in writing slick, pretty ads that win creative awards. But I can promise you copy that
            generates leads, creates awareness, and increases your sales. I challenge you to try me out and see if I
            don’t top every agency-experienced writer that you've worked with.

    <div class="explanation">
        <p class="">Shortly after receiving your email, I'll do an analysis to see how much can you benefit from
            copywriting. If all is well, I'll soon shoot you a quote and project timeline.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="">That's when the project officially begins. I'll give you an in-depth questionnaire to fill out so I
            can find out more about your market, competition and target audience. I will analyse your answers and do a
            bunch of additional market research. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">The next step is creating a strategy regarding how your copy can best reach your audience. Following
            that will be the implementation of said strategy which will be finished by the agreed timeline. Next, I
            allow unlimited revisions and patiently wait until you are happy with your copy.</p>
